    "Regularization involves fitting a model involving all the input variables. It shrinks the value of our variables to be closer to zero relative to the least squares estimates. This reduces our variance and prevents overfitting. In some cases, our coefficients can be estimated to be exactly zero. This gives the added bonus of helping with variable selection. Overall, regularization significantly reduces the variance of the model by shrinking the values of our coefficients towards zero, without substantial increase to bias."

    "You would want to use model 1 to predict TenYearCHD. The avg f1 score of model 1 is higher. F1 scores can range from 0 to 1, with 1 representing a model that perfectly classifies each observation and 0 representing models that are unable to correctly classify an observation. So we want to chose model one because its avg f1 score is higher than model two."
