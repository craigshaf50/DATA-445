    "The perceptron was the first neural model and it is a neural network with with a single layer of input linear neurons followed by an output unit based on the sign(x) function. It is a machine learning algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. If x is greater than 0 the output is 1, but if x is less than or equal to 0 then the output is 0. When a sample is misclassified, the weights are corrected proportional to the difference between the actual linear output and the true label. This is done in an effort to increase the performance of the model. The perceptron essentially creates a decision boundary to separate them to 1 or 0."
